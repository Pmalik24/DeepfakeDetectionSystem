# **Image Based Deep Fake Detection System**
The rise of deepfake technologies, which manipulate facial images to create hyper-realistic but fabricated media, poses significant risks to security, privacy, and public trust. Deepfakes can be used maliciously, making the need for reliable detection systems critical. Our project aims to develop a robust image-based deepfake detection system using Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ViTs have the ability to capture global image relationships, enabling them to detect subtle facial artifacts and inconsistencies that are often present in deepfakes. 

To train and fine-tune our model, we will use the FaceForensics++ dataset, which includes real and manipulated images created through various deepfake techniques. Additionally, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) will be employed to augment the dataset by generating synthetic deepfake images, further enhancing the systemâ€™s ability to generalize and detect previously unseen deepfakes. The goal is to improve detection accuracy and minimize false negatives, ensuring a higher level of safety and reliability in practical applications.
